🌱 Learning and Development
*  Python: Diving into Python to leverage its versatility in web development, scripting, and data analysis.
*  Django & Flask: Planning to explore these Python frameworks to enhance my back-end development skills, Django for robust web applications and Flask for more straightforward, lighter back-end services.
*  Rust: Intrigued by Rust's performance and safety features, I am eager to understand how it can be utilized in system-level programming and potentially in web development.
*  Personal Projects: Actively working on personal projects to apply and hone my skills, available for viewing on my GitHub. Feedback is always welcome!
